"Unique project where a gentleman donated a small piece of land to a 65 yr old man who was homeless. I negotiated a donation of a shed that was then finished throughout with insulation, electrical, metal roofing and more to make it a 160 sq. ft. home. We even built porch steps for easy entry. We aren't in the tiny home business, and there was no expense to HFH, but this was an opportunity to partner & coordinate with local residents, businesses and ReStore finish and furnish the home, including a compost toilet. I had to report it because of it's uniqueness. Someone who'd been homeless for more than 8 years now lives in an affordable home where his payments are exactly 30% of SSI. We'd partnered with another org to help get his SSI going, as he had no license, address, etc. Very awesome ""God Thing"" is all I know how to describe it."

The exterior of their 1916 home was deteriorating and an attached deck was in danger of collapsing.  Through this project we were able to fortify the integrity of the deck, replace rotted wood and seal the deck to extend it's life and make it safe to be on.  Exterior wood siding was rotting in areas and potentially leaking into the home, caulking, sealant, primer and new paint will extend the life of the wood siding and make the interior of the home secure and the Long's will be able to Age in Place!!"

"After completing a repair on the interior of this home in 2020, it was discovered that several hail storms had damaged the owner's roof, and the roof was now leaking and damaging all the brand new construction. An emergency repair was performed in November of 2020 by a subcontractor until they could replace the roof in the summer of 2021. Unfortunately the pricing of materials made it impossible for us to do this repair sooner, or with the subcontractor who had originally patched the roof. While grant funding was sought for this repair, we were unable to locate funds and ultimately completed the repair ourselves once the homeowner had paid off their previous promissory note for the repair work done in 2020."

"The family had sold their farm due to illness of the mother.  Then the father became ill and they could not finish a rough structure they could live in.  We plumbed, laid floors, sheet rocked and painted so they could live there through the winter.  We finished before the first snow and as the mother was half way through treatment for her second battle with cancer.  This spring we returned to finish the exterior.  We learned that the mother had been in remission but was now terminal.  Her greatest wish was to see the house completed.  We finished the house in July.  She is on Hospice at her completed home which has given her great comfort."

"Mr. Hafey is a Vietnam Veteran who suffers from the effects of being exposed to Agent Orange.  He is fully bound to a wheelchair and no longer has feeling in his feet.  Despite this, Mr. Hafey works unfailingly to provide support to fellow veterans through his local chapter of Vietnam Veterans of America, of which he is Vice President.  He was referred to Team Rubicon (TR) by the chapter President, who then approached Habitat to help replace a severely leaking roof.  By offering Habitat and TR volunteer labor to remove and dispose of roofing materials, Belford Roofing was able to lower their original estimate by 50% and arrange for free delivery (and booming to the roof) of all materials.  Unfortunately, there were some unforeseen expenses that caused us to go overbudget on this particular repair, but Mr. Hafey's insurance company raised his home's assessment value by nearly eight times what we spent and decreased his insurance premiums each month."

Construction was done for a single mother who purchased an older mobile home.  She had originally thought she just needed help laying the flooring but found out there is significant water damage that required new subfloors also.  The build crew helped with this and will be returning with a volunteer licensed plumber to evaluate completely redoing the plumbing due to galvanized pipes and one had burst and caused the water damage.  This was not disclosed to her at her purchase time.
